// TinyTang: the desktop text layer.
//
// 80 columns by 45 rows of 8x8 cells, each cell carrying its own foreground and
// background colour.  It is what TinyDesk draws into, and it is a separate,
// additive layer: the legacy 32x28 page in textdisp.v, the core's own menu and
// every stock host are untouched by it.
//
// Geometry.  The layer is 640x360 in its own pixels and is presented at 2x to
// fill a 1280x720 raster exactly, so one cell covers 16x16 output pixels:
//
//     cell   = (cx[10:4], cy[9:4])        0..79 by 0..44
//     glyph  = row cy[3:1], column cx[3:1]
//
// i.e. output pixel (cx, cy) shows source pixel (cx>>1, cy>>1), which is the
// cell that contains it at the glyph bit that includes it.  Both is the same
// statement; the bit ranges are written out because that is what the hardware
// does and the mapping is the whole contract.
//
// Clocks.  The cell store has a write port on `clk` (the main logic clock,
// where the transport writes cells) and a read port on `hclk` (the pixel
// clock, where the raster is generated).  That is the same dual-clock
// arrangement the legacy page's BRAM uses, and it is why this is a plain
// array rather than a generated IP: the array is what both simulation and
// synthesis can see, so the design can be checked before it reaches hardware.
//
// Latency.  The colour path is four pixels deep, so the store is addressed
// four pixels ahead of the raster -- (cx, cy) advanced by LAT, wrapping into
// the next line and the next frame exactly as hdmi.sv's counters do -- and
// `color` is the pixel for the coordinate being presented now, aligned with
// the stock one-register `rgb` path.  Addressing with the raster's own cx
// instead is not a harmless shift: the first version of this layer did, three
// deep, and pixels 0-2 of every line were computed at the end of the previous
// line, in blanking, where the address falls back
// to cell 0, so cell (0,0)'s glyph is painted down the whole left edge in that
// cell's colours.  That is what hardware showed.  The address is registered
// before the store rather than decoded combinationally into it: the look-ahead
// adds a wrap test and a carry in front of the row multiply, and unregistered
// that path closed at +0.6 ns of a 13.5 ns pixel clock.
//
// Colour.  fg and bg are 15-bit BGR5, the same encoding as the existing
// `overlay_color`, so the compositor widens them the same way.
