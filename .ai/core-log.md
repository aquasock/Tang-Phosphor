#### Coming From:

Unreleased 40fe578

#### Purpose:

Establish a hardware-proven build baseline and exercise the complete project workflow with the first `.ai`-managed audit cycle.

#### Outcome:

The Verilator extended-protocol simulation and a clean Gowin EDA 1.9.11.03 build for `GW5AST-LV138PG484AC1/I0` revision B passed, with zero setup or hold violations, worst setup slack of `+1.620 ns`, worst hold slack of `+0.202 ns`, and loadable artifact SHA-256 `7e607ff253617b1e92a8d73ade922dcd795b13c8fe2f518597811bd2262b5828`. The artifact was uploaded as `cores/console138k/tang-phosphor-audit-20260927.bin`, and its `4402580`-byte SD readback matched CRC-32 `bfe0f8e2`. The user confirmed the animated HDMI pattern and OSD appeared normally, while agent probes confirmed core ID `0x50`, protocol version 1, capabilities `0x0000000f`, magic `0x54504830`, advancing clock and frame counters, zero transport errors, and successful scratch-register write/readback with restoration to zero. The audit identified a missing documented host client, a dormant undersized FDD transmit index, an incorrect hardcoded controller update clock, and limited automated coverage for later cycles; the required `.ai` core-syntax audit passed without changing `.ai/core.md` or settled history.

#### Next Steps:

Propose a bounded remediation cycle for the in-repository host client, FDD transmit-index width, frequency-derived controller update interval, and focused regression coverage before implementing those changes.

#### Files Modified:

None.

#### Status:

- Build: PASS
- Deployment: PASS
- User Test: PASS
